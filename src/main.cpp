    So as of right now, I'm thinking that we are going to need to store our objects
    in a vector or some kind of list, and then we iterate over that list to
    save our data into a JSON file

    this would be so much easier in python but i found a framework that should help

    So when our app initializes we should parse through the json and collect all the objects
    so that we can edit & display them

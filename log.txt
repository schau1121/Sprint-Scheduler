Major issues/solutions:
- wanted users to be able to choose sorting algo during runtime 
    => utilizing strategy design pattern
- want users to be able to push events to google calendar using API but no RestAPI support in c++ since microsoft SDK (casablanca) wasnt installing correctly with vcpkg
    => wrote a python script which authenticates users and posts event.json file
- couldnt embed python into c++ file without additional libraries
    => utilized pybind11 to embed python script execution since its lightweight and has cmake compatibility

- application is memory inefficent since the same objects are created in multiple places in memory. refactoring for space efficiency requires much more work than refactoring for speed
    => next time, spend a bit extra time in planning phase and analyze space complexity from a design perspective 

Currently:
- need to test for users without credentials

- program crashes when performing other tasks before pushing (probably due to memory overflow)
    gdb exits with code 03
    pushing to google calendar right from start seems to work fine
